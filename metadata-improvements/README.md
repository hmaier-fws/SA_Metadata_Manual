# Trouble-shooting Tips

## Records fail to update to the SA Science Catalog:

Occasionally,  an item may seem to publish correctly to ScienceBase when if fact, the mdJSON did not publish.  ScienceBase items without mdJSON file attachements are not in the Science Catalog nor will the automated QA/QC checks identify issues with those records. It is strongly recommended that you check the [ScienceBase scanner](http://calcommons.info/sb2/scansb.php) for any SB records that are missing mdJSON and re-publish those records before proceeding through metadata improvements. Remember that newly-published mdJSON will not be reflected in the Science Catalog until the following day \(it updates daily overnight\).

## Must Do: mdEditor Files

All mdEditor files \(NOT just the mdJSON files\) need to be in a central location accessible to the Architecture Subgroup as well as the respective Region's personnel. These are needed to ensure future updates, corrections, or improvements can be made to any metadata. The ASG proposes that everyone post their mdEditor files to the ScienceBase folder that was set up for mdJSON during the Seattle workshop.
