# Digital Object Identifier



A Digital Object Identifier \(DOI\) is a globally unique, persistent, and resolvable identifier used to uniquely identify objects and are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information \(e.g., journal articles, research reports, data sets, official publications\).  DOIs are standardized by the International Organization of Standards \(ISO\).  DOIs are connected to the asset in perpetuity through a DOI hosting service \(e.g., DataCite or CrossRef\) that maintains the link to the resource. 

DOIs should be assigned to Service-funded assets such as dataset, services, models, and reports, with the exception of research publications where journals assign the DOIs.  Using DOIs promotes discovery and re-useability of the Serviceâ€™s work and investments in data and ensures appropriate recognition for those collecting and properly managing data assets.

The Service [Digital Object Identifier Management Tool](https://www1.usgs.gov/fws/doi/) enables Service personnel to assign DOIs, registered with [DataCite](https://datacite.org/), to Service-funded data products and other resources.  This tool is used to mint \(create\), update, publish, administer, and search for Service DOIs.  DOI required metadata includes the asset title, creator\(s\), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the resource, and an online link to the permanent repository location of resource and can be updated at any time.

Once minted, the DOI is included as an identifier in your metadata record \(Figure 2\)

This Tool was developed and is managed by the United States Geological Survey \(USGS\) [Science Analytics and Synthesis \(SAS\)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis) Science Data Management Branch, under an interagency agreement with the Service.
