# Digital Object Identifier Tool



A Digital Object Identifier \(DOI\) is a globally unique, persistent, and resolvable identifier used to uniquely identify objects and are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information \(e.g., journal articles, research reports, data sets, official publications\).  DOIs are standardized by the International Organization of Standards \(ISO\).  DOIs are connected to the asset in perpetuity through a DOI hosting service \(e.g., DataCite or CrossRef\) that maintains the link to the resource. 

DOIs should be assigned to Service-funded assets such as dataset, services, models, and reports, with the exception of research publications where journals assign the DOIs.  Using DOIs promotes discovery and re-useability of the Service’s work and investments in data and ensures appropriate recognition for those collecting and properly managing data assets.

The Service [Digital Object Identifier Management Tool](https://www1.usgs.gov/fws/doi/) enables Service personnel to assign DOIs, registered with [DataCite](https://datacite.org/), to Service-funded data products and other resources.  This tool is used to mint \(create\), update, publish, administer, and search for Service DOIs.  DOI required metadata includes the asset title, creator\(s\), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the resource, and an online link to the permanent repository location of resource and can be updated at any time.

Once minted, the DOI is included as an identifier in your metadata record \(Figure 2\)

This Tool was developed and is managed by the United States Geological Survey \(USGS\) [Science Analytics and Synthesis \(SAS\)](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis) Science Data Management Branch, under an interagency agreement with the Service.

DOIs generated by this tool should be assigned to Service-funded data products \(such as data releases, services, models, and reports\), with the exception of primary research publications published in one of the Service’s journals which are assigned through a process governed by the National Conservation Training Center. To generate data product DOIs, you need to submit brief citation metadata, including the title, creator\(s\), publication date, type of data product, abstract, dates relevant to the data, and an online link to the data. These citation metadata can be updated at any time.

### Creating and maintaining a DOI



The DOI Tool is designed to be user friendly and guide you through the process to mint, populate metadata, publish, and administer DOIs. It is important to note that there is both a “beta” and “live” version of the DOI. The [beta version](https://www1-beta.usgs.gov/fws/doi/) is useful as a training resource to become familiar with the DOI Tool.. The [live version](https://www1.usgs.gov/fws/doi/index.htm) is where you go to actually create a DOI, which can be set to hidden or public. DOIs assigned through the live version have a prefix of 10.7944.

To login to the DOI Tool:

1.       Use your Service email address and password. Once logged in, you will have “read-only” access to any record, “write” access to records that you created and to those where you have been added as a “Manager”.

#### Minting a DOI



Minting a DOI creates and reserves a DOI and DOI URL and does NOT require fully populated metadata fields. The benefit to minting the DOI early, such as in the Planning or Access Phase of the data lifecycle is efficiency.  The DOI can be referencing in related documentation, metadata, and other elements of the project, reducing the need for updating later.

To mint a DOI, follow these steps:

1.       Enter our existing metadata into the DOI Tool following the instructions provided on the site. New users are encouraged to review the “NEW USER?” section in the login page \(Figure 1\). The DOI does not need to be published publicly until the DOI metadata is completed.

The DOI is comprised of the resolvable service url, the registered prefix and a product identifier suffix \(Figure 2\). Service DOI are assigned the prefix of **10.7964.**  The DOI URL can be used as a weblink to the registered asset.



1.       Once created, the DOI is ready for use asset related metadata, reports, publications, and other elements that need to refer to DOIs as soon as necessary.

2.       During the maintain phase of the data lifecycle, any empty fields in the DOI metadata should be updated.

3.       Once the fields in the DOI metadata are fully populated, publish the DOI. This creates the digital tether to the URL for the data resource landing page.

4.       You can administer the DOI at any time using the DOI tools dashboard\(s\). See the DOI Administration section below for more information.

5.       Include the DOI as an identifier in your metadata record \(Figure 2b\).  As an identifier, only the prefix and suffix are needed.

6.       Include the DOI as an online resource in your metadata record \(Figure 2c\).  In this case the entire DOI url is needed.
