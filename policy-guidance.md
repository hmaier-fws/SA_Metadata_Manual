# Policy Guidance

### Non Duplication Policy

Based on a 2017 OIG audit, minimal metadata fields are required to be published within 30-days of project funding. The purpose of this policy is to share information with partners regarding what science projects SA is supporting.  This transparency helps to reduce duplication of efforts across funding agencies and allows partners to engage in SA supported science as desired.
