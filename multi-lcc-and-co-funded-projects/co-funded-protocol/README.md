# Co-funded Protocol

There are two types of co-funded protocols. 

1\) One or more region or program provides funding for a project and the project can not be divided into distinct sub-projects to be attributed separately to any region or program.  In this case, follow [for FWS multiple region or program funded Projects](for-multi-lcc-projects.md) guidance.

2\) A project is funded by a Service regional program AND by a CASC.  Again the project can not be divided into distinct sub-projects to be attributed separately.  In this case follow, [for FWS/CASC Projects](for-lcccasc-projects.md) guidance.
