# for FWS multiple region or program funded Projects

## Applicability

Refer to this protocol if:

* One or more region or program co-funds a project with one or more region or program and there are not distinct sub-projects that can be attributed separately to any region or program.

## Metadata Responsibility

The lead regional data manager is responsible for project and product metadata. There should only be one metadata record for each multi-regional or programmatic project and product. These records will show up and be searchable in the Science Catalog for each collaborating entity identified in the metadata.

In addition to standard metadata requirements, enter the following for the multi-regional or program project and product records:

## Main/Point of Contacts

Add the name of all funding entities as a “collaborator.”

{% hint style="info" %}
The lead region or program should be listed as “administrator” and does not need to be added again as a “collaborator.”
{% endhint %}

## Main/Abstract

Add the following text as as the last sentence:

"This \[project/product\] was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple USFWS regions and/or programs: Region A, Region B, and Region C.”

* Example: This project was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple USFWS regions: Upper Midwest Region 3, Northeast Region 5 .
* Example: This product was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple USFWS regions and programs:  Midwest Region 3 Science Applications and Migratory Birds Programs.

## Metadata/Metadata Contacts

Default is USFWS as “publisher.”

Collaborators do not need to be listed here.

## Funding \(for Projects only\)

Add a separate funding allocation for each year and each region or program that provided funding.

1. The source should be U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \(or other agency that provided project funding such as Bureau of Reclamation\)
2. Add the funding region or program as the “administrator” in the Other Contacts section \(see Figure 2 and 3\).
