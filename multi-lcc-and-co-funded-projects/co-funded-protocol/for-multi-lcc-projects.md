# for FWS multiple region or program funded Projects

## Applicability

Refer to this protocol if:

* One or more regions or programs each contribute funding for a project and distinct sub-projects can not identified and attributed to any region or program.

## Metadata Responsibility

The lead region or program data manager is responsible for project and product metadata. There should only be one metadata record for each multi-regional or programmatic project and product. These records will be searchable in the Science Catalog for each collaborating entity identified in the metadata.

In addition to standard metadata requirements as described in [Project Entry Guidance](../../project-entry-guidance/), include the following additions.

## Main/Point of Contacts

Add the name of all funding entities as a “collaborator.”

{% hint style="info" %}
The lead region or program should be listed as “administrator” and does not need to be added again as a “collaborator.”
{% endhint %}

## Main/Abstract

Add the following text as as the last sentence:

"This \[project/product\] was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple USFWS regions and/or programs: Region A, Region B, and Region C.”

* Example: This project was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple USFWS regions: Upper Midwest Region 3, Northeast Region 5 .
* Example: This product was a collaborative effort and co-funded by multiple USFWS regions and programs:  Midwest Region 3 Science Applications and Migratory Birds Programs.

## Metadata/Metadata Contacts

Default is USFWS as “publisher.”

Collaborators do not need to be listed here.

## Funding \(for Projects only\)

Add a separate funding allocation for each year and each region or program that provided funding as described in [Funding Tab: Project](../../project-entry-guidance/funding-tab.md).

1. The source should be U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \(or other agency that provided project funding such as Bureau of Reclamation\)
2. Add the funding region or program associated with the amount as the “administrator” in the Other Contacts section \(see Figure 2\).
