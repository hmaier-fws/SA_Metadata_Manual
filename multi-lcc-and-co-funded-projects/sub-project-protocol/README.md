# Sub-Project Protocol

## Applicability

Refer to this protocol if:

1. A region or program funds a distinct portion or sub-project of a project or a distinct product of project supported by another region or program; or
2. A FWS region or program funds a distinct portion of a CASC project.

In this case, the funding information should only be entered in a project metadata record once. If the funding for a sub-project is distributed separately, then it can be included in the sub-project metadata. Otherwise, if the sub-project was funded from a parent project and the funding allocation is not distinctly identified, then all the funding information should be included in the parent project metadata. A single funding allocation should NOT be duplicated in multiple metadata records.
