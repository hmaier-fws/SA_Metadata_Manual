# Collaborating Protocol

## Applicability

Refer to this protocol if:

* Multiple regions collaborate on a single project where only one region provided funding \(the funding region is the lead\). There can only be one lead region per project.

## Metadata Responsibility

The lead region data manager is responsible for project and product metadata. There should only be one metadata record for each collaborating project and product. These records will show up and be searchable in the Science Catalog for each collaborating regions identified in the metadata.

{% hint style="info" %}
If the project is collaborative between multiple regions but does not involve any funding allocations, the relevant regions should determine who will be the lead region and be responsible for entering the metadata.
{% endhint %}

In addition to standard metadata requirements, enter the following for projects with multiple regional collaborators:

## Main/Point of Contacts

Add the collaborating region\(s\) as a “collaborator.”

## Main/Citation/Responsible Parties

Add the collaborating LCC\(s\) as a “collaborator.”

{% hint style="info" %}
The lead LCC should be listed as “administrator” and does not need to be added again as a “collaborator.”
{% endhint %}

Here, UMGL LCC led the project with funding support from ETPBR LCC._

## Metadata/Metadata Contacts

Include the lead LCC in Metadata Contacts \(choosing the appropriate role - see [Metadata Tab: Project](../project-entry-guidance/metadata-tab.md) for more info\).

Collaborating LCCs do not need to be listed here.
